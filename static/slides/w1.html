* Introduce yourself
* Why are you here?
* What pronouns would you like us to use for you for this class?
* What was one thing you did not related to academic work over winter break?
]

---

# A few class policies

--
* Be kind


--
* Be understanding and have patience, with others **and yourself**


--
* Help others whenever possible


--
Truly the most important part of this class. Important not just in terms of decency, but also in your learning, and most importantly, for equity. 

---
# A more specific policy
### Kiddos in class

--

* All breastfeeding babies are welcome in class as often as necessary.

--

* Non-nursing babies and older children are welcome whenever alternate arrangements cannot be made. As a parent of two young children, I understand that babysitters fall through, partners have conflicting schedules, children get sick, and other issues arise that leave parents with few other options.

---

* In cases where children come to class, I invite parents/caregivers to sit close to the door so as to more easily excuse yourself to attend to your child's needs. Non-parents in the class: please reserve seats near the door for your parenting classmates.

--

* All students are expected to join with me in creating a welcoming environment that is respectful of your classmates who bring children to class.

---

# In-person class

---
# In-person class
* This class is in-person

* Your class participation grade comes exclusively from your active participation in the class through discussions and hands-on lab sessions

* If you are not feeling well, please do not attend in person

* See syllabus for attendance policy

---
# Last intro thing

* I'm here for you

* We won't have specific office hours, but know I'm always willing to meet

* This course, like all in the sequence, can be difficult. Don't suffer in silence. Don't do this alone.

# Materials
* Nearly everything will be distributed through the repo and through the website.

* Please clone the repo now, if you haven't already. Pull each week for the most recent changes.

* We'll use Canvas for grading, and that is essentially it.

---
# R Markdown notes
* These slides were produced with [**{xaringan}**](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan), an R Markdown variant. I encourage you to try it out and use it for your final project presentation.

* The website was also produced with R Markdown (sort of)
  + It's a [**{blogdown}**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) website with some custom CSS and Hugo shortcodes
  
* This course is not just about data viz, but also mediums for communication. This includes websites and [data dashboards](https://jenthompson.me/examples/insight_progress.html) among other possibilities.

class: inverse-red middle

# My assumptions about you

---
# I assume you

* Understand the R package ecosystem (how to find, install, load, and learn about them)


--
* Can read "flat" (i.e., rectangular) datasets into R 

  + I don't care what you use, but you should be using RStudio Projects &amp; the [{here}](https://github.com/r-lib/here) package

    - See [Jenny Bryan's blog post](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/) for why.



---
* Can perform basic data wrangling and transformations in R, using the
tidyverse  

  + Leverage appropriate functions for introductory data science tasks (pipeline)
  + "clean up" the dataset using scripts and reproducible workflows

--
* Use R Markdown to create reproducible dynamic reports

--
* Use version control with R via git and GitHub  

--
* Indeed, all of today's lab is going to be about that! 


---
# Learning objectives

* Transform data in a variety of ways to create effective data visualizations


--
* Understand best practices in data visualization


--

* Create and customize graphics in a variety of ways using best practices (e.g., visual perception, color choices, text annotations, categorical axis ordering, uncertainty)


--

* Build web-based platforms for sharing data visualizations


---

# Data viz "in the wild" presentations
Everyone will be randomly assigned a date to share two data visualizations you have found in publications, websites, or anywhere else IRL.

* Not a formal presentation

* Share the links with me before class - we'll look at it as a group and discuss

* You note where you found it and what you like/dislike about it

# Presentation order

# Final Project 
70 points total (35%)

---
# Group project

* Please try to finalize your group by the end of today. You will have time when exploring the course data to work together.

* No fewer than 2, no more than 3.

* Although the final is the only mandated group project, I encourage you to work with your group for all labs and the lab assignments as well.

---
# Three parts
* Proposal (20 points)

* Presentation (20 points)

* Product (30 points)


---
# Product

### Four components: 

* A web-deployed portfolio showcasing your [#dataviz](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23DataViz&amp;src=tyah)
  skills.
  + [distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) (what I'll lecture on), 
    [R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html), or
    [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) website, or 
    [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html)
  + Technical document with [pagedown](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown) or
    [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/)
  + Scientific poster with [pagedown](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown)
  + [flexdashboard](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/)

---

* At least four finalized data displays, with each accompanied by a strong 
  narrative/story, as well as the history of how the visualization changed over 
  time.
  
* Housed on GitHub
  + Fully reproducible

* Deployed through [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) (or netlify or similar)


---
# Proposal

### Four components:

* Show me some evidence that you've at least played around with some data and that you have some ideas of what you want to do

* *Very* preliminary visualizations, and/or hand-sketches of visuals you'd like to make, noting the data sources/columns to be used

* Identification of the intended audience for each viz 

* The intended message to be communicated for each viz 


--
## Main point - feedback!

---
# Draft

* Expected to still be a work in progress
  + Data visualizations should be largely complete

* Deployment not expected

* Can be provided to your peers so they can learn from you as much as you can learn from their feedback

---
# Peer Review
* We are all professionals here. It is imperative we act like it. 

* Understand the purpose of the exercise.  

* Zero tolerance policy for inappropriate comments

* Should be vigorously encouraging 

--

### Utilizing GitHub

* Fork their repo, embed comments &amp; suggest changes to their code, submit a PR

---
# Presentation 
Order randomly assigned. Basically a chance to share what you created!

* Presentation length will be determined later, but likely to be in the 10-15 minute range (note - you will present as a group)

* Share the final products

* Share the prior iterations

* Discuss the progression along the way and why specific changes were made

* What challenges did you face along the way? What victories did you have that you are particularly proud of?
