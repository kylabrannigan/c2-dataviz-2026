# Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

1. Explain the purpose of version control and the difference between Git and GitHub
2. Create a new repository on GitHub
3. Clone a repository to their local computer
4. Make changes, stage, commit, and push to GitHub
5. Fork a repository and create a pull request
6. Follow best practices for collaborative version control

**Time Required**: Approximately 90 minutes (60 min instruction + 30 min hands-on practice)

---

# Part 1: Introduction to Version Control (10 minutes)

## Why Version Control?

Version control systems solve common problems in research and development:

- **Multiple versions problem**: Eliminate `thesis_final.docx`, `thesis_final_v2.docx`, `thesis_final_ACTUAL.docx`
- **Change tracking**: Know exactly what changed, when, and why
- **Collaboration**: Multiple people can work on the same project simultaneously
- **Experimentation**: Try new approaches without fear of breaking working code
- **History**: Complete record of project evolution with ability to revert

## Git vs. GitHub

**Git** is the version control system:
- Distributed version control software
- Runs locally on your computer
- Tracks changes to files over time
- Created by Linus Torvalds in 2005

**GitHub** is the hosting platform:
- Web-based hosting service for Git repositories
- Facilitates collaboration and code sharing
- Provides additional features (issues, pull requests, wikis)
- Not the only option (GitLab, Bitbucket exist too)

## Key Concepts

- **Repository (Repo)**: A project folder containing files and complete history
- **Commit**: A snapshot of your project at a specific point in time
- **Branch**: A parallel version of your repository (we'll focus on `main`)
- **Fork**: Your personal copy of someone else's repository
- **Clone**: Downloading a repository to your local computer
- **Push**: Uploading local commits to GitHub
- **Pull**: Downloading updates from GitHub to local computer
- **Remote**: The version of repository hosted on GitHub
- **Local**: The version on your computer

---

# Part 2: Creating Your First Repository (15 minutes)

## Step-by-Step: Create Repository on GitHub

1. Navigate to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in

2. Click the **"+"** icon in the upper right corner

3. Select **"New repository"**

4. Configure repository settings:
   - **Repository name**: `my-first-repo` (use lowercase, hyphens for spaces)
   - **Description**: Brief explanation of the project (optional but recommended)
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private
   - **Initialize this repository with**:
     - ☑️ Add a README file (check this!)
   
5. Click **"Create repository"**

## What You Just Created

Your new repository has:
- A unique URL: `https://github.com/username/my-first-repo`
- A `README.md` file (Markdown format)
- A default branch called `main`
- An automatically generated commit (the initial commit)

## Editing README on GitHub

The README file is the front page of your repository. Let's edit it:

1. Click on `README.md` in your repository file list

2. Click the **pencil icon** (✏️) to edit

3. Add content using Markdown:

```markdown
# My First Repository

This is my first GitHub repository where I'm learning version control.

## About Me
I'm a student learning educational data science and research methods.

## What I'm Learning
- Version control with Git
- Collaboration workflows
- Research reproducibility
```

4. Scroll to **"Commit changes"** section at bottom

5. Add a descriptive commit message: "Update README with introduction"

6. Optional: Add extended description in larger text box

7. Click **"Commit changes"**

## Understanding Commits

Each commit has:
- **Unique identifier (hash)**: e.g., `a1b2c3d4`
- **Author**: Who made the changes
- **Timestamp**: When changes were made
- **Commit message**: Why changes were made
- **Changes**: Exactly what was modified

---

# Part 3: Cloning to Your Local Computer (15 minutes)

## Prerequisites

Ensure students have:
- Git installed on their computer
- Terminal/Command Prompt access
- GitHub account credentials configured

## Cloning Your Repository

**Cloning** creates a local copy of a remote repository.

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. On your GitHub repository page, click the green **"Code"** button

2. Select **HTTPS** tab

3. Copy the URL (looks like: `https://github.com/username/my-first-repo.git`)

4. Open Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt/Git Bash (Windows)

5. Navigate to desired location:
```bash
cd ~/Documents  # or your preferred location
```

6. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/my-first-repo.git
```

7. Navigate into the repository:
```bash
cd my-first-repo
```

## What Cloning Provides

After cloning, you have:
- Complete copy of all files
- Entire commit history
- Connection to remote repository (called `origin`)
- Ability to work offline
- All branches (if multiple exist)

## Verifying Your Clone

Check repository status:
```bash
git status
```

Expected output:
```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

View remote connections:
```bash
git remote -v
```

Expected output:
```
origin  https://github.com/username/my-first-repo.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/username/my-first-repo.git (push)
```

# Part 4: The Git Workflow (20 minutes)

## The Three States

```
Working Directory → Staging Area → Repository
     (modify)         (stage)       (commit)
```

1. **Working Directory**: Where you edit files
2. **Staging Area (Index)**: Where you prepare commits
3. **Repository**: Where committed snapshots are stored

## Creating and Tracking a New File

### Create a learning log:

```bash
# Option 1: Create empty file
touch learning-log.md

# Option 2: Create and edit in one step
nano learning-log.md   # or code, vim, etc.
```

### Add content to `learning-log.md`:

```markdown
# Learning Log

## January 6, 2026

Today I learned:
- How to create a GitHub repository
- How to clone a repository to my computer
- The difference between Git and GitHub
- The importance of commit messages

## Questions
- How do branches work?
- When should I create a new repository vs. a new branch?
```

Save and close the file.

## The Add-Commit-Push Cycle

### 1. Check Status
```bash
git status
```

Output shows untracked file:
```
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        learning-log.md
```

### 2. Stage Changes
```bash
git add learning-log.md

# Alternative: stage all changes
git add .
```

Verify staging:
```bash
git status
```

Output now shows:
```
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   learning-log.md
```

### 3. Commit Changes
```bash
git commit -m "Add initial learning log entry"
```

Successful commit output:
```
[main 1a2b3c4] Add initial learning log entry
 1 file changed, 8 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 learning-log.md
```

### 4. Push to GitHub
```bash
git push origin main
```

Successful push output:
```
Enumerating objects: 4, done.
Counting objects: 100% (4/4), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 345 bytes
To https://github.com/username/my-first-repo.git
   a1b2c3d..e4f5g6h  main -> main
```

## Writing Effective Commit Messages

### Best Practices:

✅ **Good commit messages:**
- "Add data cleaning script for CRDC dataset"
- "Fix missing value handling in suspension analysis"
- "Update README with installation instructions"
- "Remove deprecated visualization functions"

❌ **Poor commit messages:**
- "stuff"
- "changes"
- "update"
- "asdf"
- "fix"

### Commit Message Structure:

```
Short summary (50 characters or less)

More detailed explanation if needed (wrap at 72 characters).
Explain the problem this commit solves and why you made 
the change, not how you made it.

- Bullet points are okay
- Use imperative mood: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
```

## Practice Exercise

Have students:
1. Create a new entry in their learning log
2. Stage the changes
3. Commit with a descriptive message
4. Push to GitHub
5. Verify changes appear on GitHub

# Part 5: Forking and Collaboration (20 minutes)

## Understanding Forks

**Forking** creates your own copy of someone else's repository on GitHub.

### Fork vs. Clone:

| Action | Location | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Fork | GitHub → GitHub | Create your copy on GitHub |
| Clone | GitHub → Local | Download to your computer |

### When to Fork:

- Contributing to open source projects
- Building on someone else's work
- Creating personal version of a project
- Collaborating with classmates
- Experimenting without affecting original

## Forking Workflow

### 1. Fork a Repository

1. Navigate to the repository you want to fork
2. Click **"Fork"** button (top right)
3. Select destination (your account)
4. GitHub creates: `yourusername/repository-name`

### 2. Clone Your Fork

```bash
# Clone YOUR fork, not the original
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
cd repository-name
```

### 3. Make Changes

Work as normal:
```bash
# Create new file
nano peer-review.md

# Stage changes
git add peer-review.md

# Commit
git commit -m "Add peer review feedback"

# Push to YOUR fork
git push origin main
```

### 4. Create Pull Request

1. Go to your fork on GitHub
2. Click **"Contribute"** → **"Open pull request"**
3. Review changes
4. Add title: "Add peer review feedback"
5. Add description:
   ```
   I've added a peer review file with feedback on your repository
   organization and documentation. Great work overall!
   ```
6. Click **"Create pull request"**

## Pull Request Best Practices

When creating a pull request:
- **Be descriptive**: Explain what and why
- **Reference issues**: If fixing a bug, mention issue number
- **Keep it focused**: One feature/fix per PR
- **Test your code**: Ensure it works before submitting
- **Be respectful**: Remember there's a human reviewing

When reviewing a pull request:
- **Be constructive**: Suggest improvements positively
- **Ask questions**: Seek clarification when needed
- **Test changes**: Pull the branch and verify functionality
- **Acknowledge effort**: Thank contributors

---

# Part 6: Best Practices and Tips (10 minutes)

## Git Best Practices

### 1. Commit Frequently
- Small, focused commits are better than large ones
- Each commit should represent one logical change
- Makes it easier to find and revert bugs

### 2. Write Clear Commit Messages
- First line: concise summary (50 chars)
- Blank line
- Detailed explanation if needed

### 3. Sync Before Pushing
```bash
# Always pull before pushing
git pull origin main
git push origin main
```

### 4. Use .gitignore
Never commit:
- Sensitive data (passwords, API keys)
- Large data files
- Temporary files
- System files

Example `.gitignore`:
```
# R specific
.Rproj.user/
.Rhistory
.RData
.Ruserdata
*.Rproj

# Data files (if large)
*.csv
data/
raw_data/

# Output files
*.pdf
*.html
output/

# System files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
*~

# Temporary files
*.tmp
.ipynb_checkpoints/
```

### 5. Protect Your Main Branch
- Don't commit directly to main for large projects
- Use branches for development
- Merge via pull requests

## Common Markdown Syntax

GitHub README files use Markdown:

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

**bold text**
*italic text*
***bold and italic***

- Unordered list item
- Another item

1. Numbered list item
2. Another numbered item

[Link text](http://example.com)

![Image alt text](image-url.jpg)

`inline code`

```
code block
with multiple lines
```

> Blockquote text
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Permission denied" when pushing
```bash
# Ensure you're authenticated
git remote -v  # Check remote URL
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

### Accidentally committed sensitive data
```bash
# Remove file and commit
git rm --cached sensitive_file.txt
echo "sensitive_file.txt" >> .gitignore
git commit -m "Remove sensitive file"
git push origin main
```

### Want to undo uncommitted changes
```bash
# Discard changes to specific file
git restore filename

# Discard all uncommitted changes (CAREFUL!)
git restore .
```

### Made a mistake in last commit message
```bash
# Amend the most recent commit message
git commit --amend -m "Corrected commit message"

# If already pushed (CAREFUL! Rewrites history)
git push --force origin main
```

### Merge conflicts
```bash
# When pulling creates conflicts
git pull origin main
# Fix conflicts in files marked with <<<<<<< and >>>>>>>
git add conflicted_file.txt
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict"
git push origin main
```

# Assessment and Follow-Up

## Formative Assessment

During class, check for understanding:
- Can students explain difference between Git and GitHub?
- Can they navigate their terminal to correct directory?
- Are they writing descriptive commit messages?
- Do they understand staging vs. committing?

## Common Student Mistakes

1. **Forgetting to commit before pushing**: Remind students of the full workflow
2. **Unclear commit messages**: Emphasize importance of documentation
3. **Working in wrong directory**: Show how to check location with `pwd`
4. **Confusion between fork and clone**: Use analogies and diagrams
5. **Fear of breaking things**: Emphasize that Git makes it hard to permanently lose work

## Next Steps

In future lessons, cover:
- Branching and merging
- Resolving merge conflicts
- Collaborative workflows (feature branch workflow)
- GitHub Issues and project management
- Git with R/RStudio integration
- Advanced Git operations (rebase, cherry-pick, stash)

---

# Notes for Instructor

## Pre-Class Setup
- Verify all students have GitHub accounts
- Ensure Git is installed on lab computers
- Test internet connectivity
- Prepare backup examples in case student repos aren't ready
- Have students install a text editor (VS Code, Atom, Sublime)

## Pacing Tips
- Part 1 (Intro): Don't rush; ensure everyone understands concepts
- Part 2 (Creating Repo): Live demo as students follow along
- Part 3 (Cloning): Anticipate terminal navigation issues
- Part 4 (Workflow): Most important section; take time here
- Part 5 (Forking): Pair students to practice collaboration
- Part 6 (Best Practices): Can be asynchronous reading if time is short

## Troubleshooting Prep
- Have a backup plan if GitHub is down
- Know how to handle authentication issues
- Be ready to explain Windows/Mac/Linux differences
- Have solution for students who didn't bring laptops

## Active Learning Strategies
- Think-pair-share for conceptual questions
- Live coding with students following
- Peer review of commit messages
- Partner exercises for forking workflow
