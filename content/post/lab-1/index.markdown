## Overview
This lab covers the basics of working with *git* and *GitHub* collaboratively. You can plan to work individually/together with your group.

The basics of the lab are to:

* **Create** your own repository with a README
* **Clone** your repository locally
* **Make changes** and commit them
* **Fork** a classmate's repository
* **Contribute** with a pull request

## Submission
* Submit a link to the repo through Canvas when you've completed the lab
* I check the commit history, and give each person credit

## Finishing up
It is expected that this lab will take you more time than we will devote to it in class. Class time should be used to clarify any points of confusion and if you run into issues after class, please get in touch with me so we can arrange a time to meet and I can help you.

Once you have finished, please go to Canvas and submit a link to your repo.
